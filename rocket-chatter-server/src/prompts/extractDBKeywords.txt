INPUT: User's text query in either natural language or code format.

TASKS:
- NEVER USE backslash in any of the keywords even if it's part of the query.
- Extract the possible keywords from the user's query.
- Query the database to find the nodes names of which are similar to what user has requested.
- If you are unable to extract the keywords, return an empty array.
- EXTRACT THE KEYWORDS IN SUCH A WAY THAT EACH STRING AS ONE WORD ELEMENT ONLY.

EXAMPLE:
- INPUT:
   "Find the codebase for the user query CRC_TABLE in the main.ts'
- OUTPUT:
   <ANSWER>
      CRC_TABLE, main.ts
   </ANSWER>

OUTPUT:
<ANSWER>
   - Provide the possible keywords extracted from the user's query in a comma-separated format (unquoted).
